# freactive.core

Generic reactive atoms, expressions, cursors for Clojure(Script).

The goal of this library is to abstract the reactive atom and reactive computation
or computed observable concepts from [reagent][reagent] and [reflex][reflex], as
well as a variation of the cursor concept from [om][om]. The broader aim of this
goal is to enable a set of reactive data structures that can be shared between many
different front-end frameworks that is also based, as much as possible, only on idioms
already in Clojure core.
